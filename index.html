	<p>The purpose of this website is to give you a detailed explanation of the key points in the history of photography, all the way from the Camera Obscura effect to the modern digital cameras you see in everyday smartphones.</p>
	
	<h2>What is photography?</h2>
	<p>Photography is the practice of creating images by recording light. It is used in many different forms to create art, entertainment and jobs. Photography can useÂ light sensitive materials or by a light sensor. The word 'photography' comes from Greek words 'photos', meaning light, and 'graphe', meaning 'draw'. So, photography means 'drawing with light'.</p>

	<p><strong> 1.</strong><a href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/say-cheese.html">"Say Cheese!"</a> is a phrase people say to get other people to smile when taking photos. This is because when you say the word "cheese", the "ch" sound causes you you to clench your teeth and the "ee" sound parts your lips, making it look like you're smiling. While no one knows where the phrase came from, it is believed that Joseph E. Davies phrase, and was first referenced  in The Big Spring Herald newspaper sometime in the 1940's.</p>

The Afton Limited locomotive would run an express service between Chicago and St Louis. It had 6 cars built with perfect symmetry with identical windows and the cars having the same height and width each. The Chicago and Afton Railway hired George R. Lawrence to take the photo, he  designed the camera and then it was manufactured by J.A. Anderson. The camera was made from cherry wood and had a glass plate measuring 2 by 1 and half meters, the camera weighted over 900 pounds (roughly 408 kg).  </p>
